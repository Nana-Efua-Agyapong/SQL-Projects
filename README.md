# SQL-Projects
This is a project which was analyzed by my teammates and I. We first created a database in SQL and inserted values into our newly created tables. We created five tables in all, with at least five columns each. The data entered into SQL was a study on some South American celebrities. We then exported the data from SQL into Power BI to visualize it.
